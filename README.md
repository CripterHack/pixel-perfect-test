# Frontend Technical Interview - Landing Page

## Overview
This project is a responsive landing page developed as part of a frontend technical interview. It showcases skills in responsive design, pixel-perfect implementation, and modern web development practices. The implementation is based on designs provided through the Zeplin platform, demonstrating the ability to accurately translate design specifications into functional code.

## Design Implementation
- Original designs provided via Zeplin platform
- Pixel-perfect implementation following Zeplin specifications
- Accurate color values and typography from design system
- Asset management through Zeplin's resource management
- Precise spacing and layout measurements
- Style guide compliance

## Key Features
- Fully responsive design
- Pixel-perfect implementation from Zeplin specs
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Interactive elements (accordion, tabs, testimonials)
- Custom typography and color schemes
- Optimized image loading with srcset
- Modern CSS practices including Grid and Flexbox

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- TailwindCSS
- jQuery
- Slick Carousel
- Google Fonts (Playfair Display, Oxygen)
- Zeplin (design handoff platform)

## Technical Highlights
- CSS custom properties for consistent theming
- Intersection Observer API for scroll animations
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Progressive image loading
- Semantic HTML structure
- BEM-like CSS naming conventions
- Performance optimizations
- Design-to-code accuracy using Zeplin specifications

## Development Requirements
- Modern web browser
- Code editor (VS Code recommended)
- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Knowledge of responsive design principles

- Familiarity with CSS frameworks (TailwindCSS)
- Experience with design handoff tools (Zeplin or Figma)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Access the design specs in Zeplin (requires access credentials)
3. Open `index.html` in your browser or set up a local development server:

### Option 1: Python Simple Server
```bash
# Python 3.x
python -m http.server 8000

# Python 2.x
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```
Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

### Option 2: Node.js HTTP Server
```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g http-server

# Run server
http-server -p 8000
```
Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

### Option 3: PHP Built-in Server
```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```
Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

### Option 4: VS Code Live Server
1. Install "Live Server" extension in VS Code
2. Right click on `index.html`
3. Select "Open with Live Server"

### Option 5: Browser Extension
- Install "Web Server for Chrome" extension
- Choose your project folder
- Access through provided local URL

4. No build process required - everything is included via CDN

## Best Practices Demonstrated
- Semantic HTML5 elements
- CSS custom properties for maintainability
- Progressive enhancement
